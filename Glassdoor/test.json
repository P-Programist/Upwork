Incredible lack of cultural diversity (especially in executive leadership). \r\n\r\nIt seems as if every progressive trend we see in the work place that's being adopted, American remains stagnant or moves in the opposite direction.

So where individual exceptions could be made when it comes to things like attendance, or work/life balance, there is little to no consideration given for individual circumstances. \r\nManagement is old! They need younger management from the CEO down so that we could truly work in this century. Plus the CEO is often talking smack about what departments he hopes to get rid of and why reservations is only an entry level position and not one for families to be raised on...even though many of his reservationist have over 10 years of experience.\r\nAnd let’s not even talk about the inconsistencies given in punishments when it comes to race.",
